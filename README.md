# Flask-Articles
First Flash Web-App

I made this partly with a tutorial, but with many fetures / stuff added myself. This was made purely to learn how to use flask and flask_mysql.

To make the admin panel (www.articles.com/admin - unfinished need to add login) I used a package named flask_admin. To remove just delete / comment out line 8, 24, 39, and 40 in app.py
***NOTE*** The admin panel uses flask_sqlalchemy so if you remove the panel you can also remove that (It is the only package that uses it) ***NOTE***
